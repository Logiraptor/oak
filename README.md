Oak is a flow based programming toolkit for the Go programming language.

This repo is very immature and unstable. Issues and Contributions are welcome.

## Goals

This project is kind of an experiment for me. At this point it works for very simple programs.
I don't want to add features just because they're cool sounding, though.
My plan is to use this as a platform for all my side projects for a while.
I'll add features here only when I can't find a simple way to implement a
feature with the existing set of features or I find an annoying use case.

That said, the implementation goals as of now are:

- Dataflow / Flow Based Programming
- Scalable Processes within the dataflow graph
- Graphical UI for building the programs
- Access to any Go package
- Multiple Targetable Environments (App Engine, CLI, WebServer, etc)
